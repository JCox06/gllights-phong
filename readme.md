## Different Components
Phong lighting consists of three components that are each added together.

This phong is implemented into worldspace.

Ambient Shading: Default lighting for when there is not a light source (no light)

Diffuse Shading: An objects colour is affected by the position of the light (lighting)

Specular Shading: The objects colour is affected by the position of the camera (reflections)
