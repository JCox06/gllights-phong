//Simple Notes about Phong lighting

#Ambient Lighting (No lighting)
-The default lighting in the scene.

#Diffuse Lighting (Direction Lighting)
-The objects colour is affected by the dot product of the light direction vector with the surface normal vector

#Specular Lighting (Reflection)
-The objects colour is affected by the dot product of the light direction vector with the surface normal vector
and the camera view direction
-The angle of the incident ray is the same as the angle of the reflected ray
